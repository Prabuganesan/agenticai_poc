# Autonomous Docker Hub Image

Starts Autonomous from [DockerHub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowiseai/flowise)

## Usage

1. Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`)
2. `docker compose up -d`
3. Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)
4. You can bring the containers down by `docker compose stop`

## 🌱 Env Variables

If you like to persist your data (flows, logs, credentials, storage), set these variables in the `.env` file inside `docker` folder:

-   DATABASE_PATH=/root/.autonomous
-   LOG_PATH=/root/.autonomous/logs
-   SECRETKEY_PATH=/root/.autonomous
-   BLOB_STORAGE_PATH=/root/.autonomous/storage

Autonomous also support different environment variables to configure your instance. Read [more](https://docs.flowiseai.com/configuration/environment-variables)
